- 👋 Hi, I’m @TechJudgeTrish
-  :)  My Bachelor's is in IT, but since my job won't move me from the file room, I am using the time to learn coding, so I can be more than IT repair chic.
- 👀 I’m interested in: Learning what I can about coding, IT, app and web design, gaming, new tech, old tech
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: C
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Unsure, I am still learning.
- 📫 How to reach me: Will post later, when I have a better handle on GIT
